# Supplier-Rating-using-Support-Vector-Machine
Retailers always face some complexity while choosing the supplier of the particular marchandise. Here, I collected the data of various suppliers with various items with their rating according to different fctors like quality, quantity, on-time delivery of the marchandise. I used Support Vector Machine algorithm to train & predict the supplier with overall rating which will help retailers to choose suppliers in accordance with multiple factors. Support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
